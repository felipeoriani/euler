# Project Euler

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve - https://projecteuler.net/

This repository was created to share my Project Euler implementations in Python programming language (version 3.4.3).

Since you have python installed and configured on your environment, to run each program type:

$> python.exe 010.py
