# Project Euler

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve - https://projecteuler.net/

This repository was created to share my Project Euler implementations in Python programming language.

Given you have python installed and configured on your environment, to run each program type:

$> python.exe 010.py
