# Project Euler

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve - https://projecteuler.net/

This repository was created to share my Project Euler implementations in Python programming language (version 2.7, but I think it is fine for 3.4 too).

Since you have python installed and configured on your environment, to run each program type:

`$> python 010.py`
